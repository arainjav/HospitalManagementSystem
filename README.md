Hospital Management System
Overview
This Hospital Management System is designed to streamline and automate the administrative and clinical operations of a hospital. It aims to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and improve patient care by integrating various hospital functions into a unified software solution.Scribd+1www.slideshare.net+1Scribd
Problem Statement
Traditional hospital management often relies on manual processes, leading to several challenges:
•	Inefficient Data Handling: Manual record-keeping is time-consuming and prone to errors, making data retrieval and management cumbersome.
•	Fragmented Information Systems: Lack of integration among different departments results in data silos, hindering effective communication and coordination.
•	Limited Accessibility: Physical records restrict access to patient information, affecting timely decision-making.
•	Security Concerns: Paper-based systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss, or damage.www.slideshare.netScribdMata Sundri College for Women+6SRM University Sikkim+6GeeksforGeeks+6
These issues necessitate the development of an integrated Hospital Management System to enhance operational efficiency and patient care.Scribd+1www.slideshare.net+1
Methodology
The development of the Hospital Management System followed a structured approach:
1.	Requirement Analysis: Identified the needs of various stakeholders, including administrators, doctors, nurses, and patients, to determine system functionalities.
2.	System Design: Created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to model the database structure, ensuring data integrity and efficient relationships among entities.
3.	Database Implementation: Developed the database schema as per the ER diagram, focusing on scalability and security.
4.	User Interface Development: Designed intuitive interfaces for different user roles to facilitate ease of use and accessibility.
5.	Testing and Validation: Conducted thorough testing to identify and rectify bugs, ensuring the system meets the specified requirements.
Conclusion
The implemented Hospital Management System successfully addresses the challenges of traditional hospital administration by providing:ResearchGate+5www.slideshare.net+5Scribd+5
